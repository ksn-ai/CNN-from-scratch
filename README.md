Source Code: Without Using Temporary Variable
In python programming, there is a simple construct to swap variables. The following code does the same as above but without the use of any temporary variable.

x,y = y,x
If the variables are both numbers, we can use arithmetic operations to do the same. It might not look intuitive at the first sight. But if you think about it, its pretty easy to figure it out.Here are a few example

Addition and Subtraction

x = x + y
y = x - y
x = x - y
Multiplication and Division

x = x * y
y = x / y
x = x / y
XOR swap

This algorithm works for integers only

x = x ^ y
y = x ^ y
x = x ^ y
